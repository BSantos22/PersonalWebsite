		<h4>User account</h4>
		<p>
		For safety and security, each customer is allowed to create only one registered account by default. For customers who attempt to create several accounts, we reserve the right to suspend accounts without further notice.</p>
		<h4>Ordering</h4>
		<p>
		Whilst all efforts are made to ensure accuracy of product descriptions, specifications and pricing there may be occasions where errors arise. Should such a situation occur .bat cannot accept your order. In the event of a mistake you will be contacted with a full explanation and a corrected offer. The information displayed is considered as an invitation to treat not as a confirmed offer for sale. The contract is confirmed upon supply of goods.
		</p>
		<p>
		Given the popularity and/or supply constraints of some of our products, .bat may have to limit the number of products available for purchase. .bat reserves the right to change quantities available for purchase at any time, even after you place an order.
		</p>

		<p>
		Both parties agree that, following order dispatch, transportation is the sole responsibility of the third-party logistics company. During this stage, full ownership of the product(s) belongs to the buyer; all associated liability and risks during transportation shall be borne by the buyer.
		</p>

		<h4>Order Cancelation</h4>
		<p>Customers can cancel their order at anytime prior to shipping; please contact our Support Center. However, once the order has been dispatched, the order cannot be canceled, changed, or refunded. Upon receipt of the package, our Warranty and Return policy comes into effect.</p>


		<h4>Shipping and Delivery</h4>

		<p>Shipping times displayed on .bat refer to the estimated time it takes for packages to leave our hands. Since the actual delivery of your order can be impacted by many events beyond .bat's control once it leaves our facilities, we suggest that if customers have a special occasion or event that they wish to use their item for, such as a birthday, that they order their items well in advance. .bat cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth shopping experience.</p>

		<p>For a smooth delivery and peace of mind, we strongly recommend that customers purchase shipping insurance during the checkout.In the event that your package has a shipping issue, .bat will send you a replacement package free of charge. If the item is no longer in stock, we will offer you a refund option.</p>

		<p>Any orders that do not have shipping insurance will not be the responibility of .bat and the customer takes full liability for their package during the shipping process.</p>

		<p>.bat provides information via banners on our site and through newsletters to customers, that provide details of shipping delays due to the Christmas peak season, and encourages customers to order in advance. We can therefore not be held responsible if a customer does not receive their order in time for Christmas.  </p>

		<p>There may be occasions when .bat confirms your order but subsequently learns that it cannot supply the ordered product. In the event we cannot supply a product you ordered in a timely fashion, .bat will contact customers and offer to cancel the order and refund purchase prices in full.
		</p>
		<p>
		We try to make the delivery process as simple as possible and we are able to send your order either to you home or to your work place. We can ship to PO Boxes via all shipping methods, except for Expedited Shipping because signatures are required upon delivery. Express shipments of this type can only be delivered to physical addresses.
		</p>
		<p>
		Shipping and delivery times are calculated in working days from Monday to Friday. In the case of major holidays such as Christmas and the Chinese Lunar New Year, please allow extra delivery time. During those special occasions we will provide notices to reflect possible delays.
		</p>

		<p>
		Customers are responsible for providing complete and accurate shipping addresses. .bat cannot make changes to your shipping address once a package has been shipped, and .bat is not liable for packages lost due to incomplete or inaccurate addresses.
		</p>
		<p>.bat cannot be held responsible for any package that does not make it through the local customs and is destroyed due to the item being illegal in the destination country. Customers are solely responsible for complying with their local laws. We can also not be held responsible for any import tax that may occur and it is the customers sole responsibility to pay this fee, if any.  </p>

		<p>Should the buyer refuse the package due to import duties or taxes, the buyer takes full liability for all the costs involved in the process.</p>

		<p>All orders reported as "delivered" by shipping companies are considered delivered. .bat cannot be made liable of non-delivery in this case.</p>

		<p>If a delivery fails for any reason and the address sent to was the correct address as provided by the customer, .bat cannot be held liable if a package is returned to us. </p>

		<p>Whatever the customer orders is what we ship. We can not be held liable for the customer receiving the wrong item if they placed the wrong order. </p>
